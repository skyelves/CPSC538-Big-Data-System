### Problem Statement (1-2 Sentences) 

What applications should be offload to network? And what challenges are there when offloading applications to network?



### Why are existing solutions insufficient? 

Most works focus on how to offload certain applications to network and rarely talk about what applications can be most beneficial of the offload. 



### Solution Summary (1-2 Sentences)

This paper presents several pricinples for in-network computation and a taxonomy to help identify which applications can benefit from in-network computation.



### 3 Strengths

S1. This paper gives a clear overall background elaboration.

S2. This paper classifies applications along three axes, which gives a framework to identify which application can benefit from in-network computation.

 

### 3 Weaknesses

O1. 'End-device deployment' is a little bit confusing. When I first read this, I thought it was to use offload applications to the end-device (client/host).

O2. Is it sufficient to measure packet gain with only the number of packets sent for each received packet?



### Validity of evaluation (strengths/weaknesses)

No evaluation.



### One Idea for Future Work

Can we implement in-network lock, which can benefit from in-network computation?
